					<p>if a Artist and a Creator decide to enter into a Service Contract, the contract is a contractual relationship directly between the Artist and the Creator; Open-Label is not responsible for and is not a party to any Service Contract and under no circumstances will any such contract create an employment or any service relationship between Open-Label and any User.</p>

					<p>With respect to any Service Contract, Artists and Creators may enter into any agreements that they deem appropriate (e.g., confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements, assignment of rights, etc.), provided that those agreements do not conflict with, narrow, or expand Open-Label’s rights and obligations under the Terms of Service, including this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions.</p>

					<p>The parties to a Service Contract can, if the parties prefer, agree to the Optional Service Contract Terms in whole or in part, in addition to or instead of other such agreements.

Users are solely responsible for deciding whether to use the Optional Service Contract Terms, and Open-Label does not assume any responsibility for any consequence of using the Optional Service Contract Terms, which are provided as a sample only and may not be appropriate for all jurisdictions or all contracts. The Optional Service Contract Terms are not intended to and do not (a) constitute legal advice, (b) create an attorney-Artist relationship, or (c) constitute advertising or a solicitation of any type. You should seek legal advice from a licensed attorney for your particular needs.</p>

					<h6>6  DISPUTES AMONG USERS</h6>

Artist warrants its decisions regarding classification are correct and its manner of engaging Creators complies with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.

					<h6>10 PAYMENT TERMS AND ESCROW SERVICES</h6>

					<p>This section describes how Open-Label’s Escrow Services work and discusses your agreement to pay Creator Service Fees on Service Contracts and Direct Contracts, what happens if a Artist doesn’t pay, and related topics.</p>

					<h6>10.1 ESCROW SERVICES</h6>

					<p>Open-Label Escrow provides escrow services to Users to deliver, hold, and receive payment for a Project, and to pay fees to Open-Label (“Escrow Services”). Open-Label Escrow is a Delaware corporation and a licensed Internet escrow agent that holds California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation License No. 963 5086. The Escrow Services are intended for business use, and you agree to use the Escrow Services only for business purposes and not for consumer, personal, family, or household purposes.</p>

					<h6>10.1.1 ESCROW INSTRUCTIONS</h6>

					<p>We follow what is in the applicable Escrow Instructions when we give the money held by us in escrow to the Creator or back to the Artist for a Service Contract.</p>

					<p>Open-Label Escrow will use and release funds deposited in an Escrow Account only in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions. You acknowledge and agree that Open-Label Escrow acts merely as an Internet escrow agent. Open-Label Escrow has fully delivered the Escrow Services to you if Open-Label Escrow provides the Escrow Services described in this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions. Open-Label Escrow is only obligated to perform those duties expressly described in this Agreement and any applicable Escrow Instructions. Open-Label will release funds from any Escrow Account in reliance on your authorization, this Agreement, and the applicable Escrow Instructions or as required by applicable law.</p>

					<p><strong>Fixed-Price Projects.</strong> If Users choose fixed-price compensation, then the Users agree that they will be bound by, and Open-Label Escrow will follow, the Fixed-Price Escrow Instructions.</p>

					<p><strong>Direct Contracts.</strong> If Users enter into a Direct Contract, then the Users agree that they will be bound by, and Open-Label Escrow will follow, the Direct Contract Escrow Instructions applicable to the contract (Fixed Price).</p>

					<p>Any Hire Contracts. If Users enter into an Any Hire Contract, then the Users agree that they will be bound by, and Open-Label Escrow will follow, the Any Hire Escrow Instructions.</p>

					<p><strong>Open-Label Payroll Engagements.</strong> If Users use Open-Label Payroll  for a particular Project, then the Staffing Employee is paid directly by the Staffing Provider. A Artist will be invoiced through the Site by the Staffing Provider, and the applicable Escrow Instructions will apply. However, the Artist will not be able to dispute hours reported by the Staffing Employee and there is no dispute waiting period for the disbursement of funds to the Staffing Employee.</p>

					<h6>10.1.2 ESCROW ACCOUNTS</h6>

					<p>Open-Label Escrow will create and maintain an account to hold funds for you—called an Escrow Account—based on your needs. You authorize Open-Label Escrow to be your escrow agent, which means to hold your funds and to follow your instructions on the funds held in your Escrow Account.</p>

					<p>Open-Label Escrow will use and release funds deposited in an Escrow Account only in accordance with this Agreement, the applicable Escrow Instructions, and applicable law. Depending on your needs and the applicable Escrow Instructions, Open-Label Escrow will establish and maintain one of two different types of Escrow Accounts:</p>

					<p><strong>(A) Artist Escrow Account</strong>. After entering into a Service Contract (hourly or fixed price) or Direct Contract, the first time a Artist makes a payment for a Project, Open-Label Escrow will establish and maintain a “Artist Escrow Account” to hold funds for the Artist to use to make payments for Projects, to receive refunds in connection with Projects, and to make payments to Open-Label.</p>

					<p><strong>(B) Creator Escrow Account.</strong> After entering into a Service Contract (fixed price) or Direct Contract, the first time a Creator uses the Site to receive payment for a Project, Open-Label Escrow will establish and maintain a “Creator Escrow Account” for Creator to receive payments for Projects, withdraw payments, make payments to Open-Label and issue refunds to Artists.</p>

					<p>You hereby authorize and instruct Open-Label Escrow to act as escrow agent in connection with the Escrow Accounts and the payment, holding, and receipt of funds for each Project and other specified purposes in accordance with the Terms of Service and the applicable Escrow Instructions. Artist and Creator may access current information regarding the status of an Escrow Account on the Site.</p>

					<h6>10.1.3 Creator APPOINTMENT OF Open-Label ESCROW AND SUBSIDIARIES AS AGENT</h6>

					<p>Creators authorize Open-Label Escrow to act for them to collect and hold payments from Artists.</p>

					<p>If you are a Creator and you request payment related to an Hourly Contract or the release of funds from a Fixed-Price Escrow Account, you hereby appoint Open-Label Escrow as your agent to obtain funds on your behalf and credit them to your Creator Escrow Account as you agree in the applicable Escrow Instructions. Because Open-Label Escrow is Creator’s agent, Creator must, and hereby does, fully discharge and credit Creator’s Artist for all payments and releases of funds that Open-Label Escrow receives on Creator’s behalf from or on behalf of such Artist.</p>

					<p>You agree that you will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds held in your Escrow Account. Open-Label, Open-Label Escrow, or our Affiliates may charge or deduct fees, may receive a reduction in fees or expenses charged.</p>

					<p><strong>Fixed-Price Contracts.</strong> Artists becomes obligated to pay applicable amounts into the Escrow Account immediately upon sending a Fixed-Price Contract offer (for the full amount or for the first milestone, if milestones are used) or upon activating any additional milestone. When Artist authorizes the payment of the Creator’s Fees for a Fixed-Price Contract under the Fixed Price Service Contract Escrow Instructions or the Fixed Price Direct Contract Escrow Instructions, Artist automatically and irrevocably authorizes and instructs Open-Label or its affiliates Open-Label Escrow . to charge Artist’s Payment Method for the Creator’s Fees.</p>

					<p>Artists acknowledges and agrees that for  Fixed-Price Contracts, failure by Artists to decline or dispute an Invoice or request for payment is an authorization and instruction to release payment, as described more fully in the applicable Escrow Instructions.</p>

					<h6>11. NO RETURN OF FUNDS AND NO CHARGEBACKS</h6>

					<p>Artists agree that, once Open-Label charges their Payment Methods, the charge cannot be refunded except on a condition agreed in the Escrow Instructions. Artists agree not to initiate any chargebacks from their credit card companies, banks, or the like.</p>

					<p>Artist acknowledges and agrees that Open-Label. may charge or debit Artist’s designated Payment Method for the Creator Fees incurred as described in the applicable Escrow Instructions and the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement. Once Open-Label or its affiliates Open-Label Escrow. charges or debits the Artist’s designated Payment Method for the Creator Fees, the charge or debit is non-refundable, except as provided in the applicable Escrow Instructions or as otherwise required by applicable law. Artist also acknowledges and agrees that the Terms of Service provide a dispute resolution process as a way for Artist to resolve disputes. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Artist therefore agrees not to ask its credit card company, bank, or other Payment Method provider to charge back any Creator Fees or other fees charged pursuant to the Terms of Service for any reason. A chargeback in breach of this obligation is a material breach of the Terms of Service. If Artist initiates a chargeback in violation of this Agreement, Artist agrees that Open-Label or its affiliates Open-Label Escrow. may dispute or appeal the chargeback, institute collection action against Artist, close Artist’s account, and take such other action it deems appropriate.</p>

					<h6>12. RECORDS OF COMPLIANCE</h6>

					<p>You agree to make and keep all required records.</p>

					<p>You are solely responsible for creation, storage, and backup of your business records. You agree that Open-Label  has no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or information that you provide, except to the extent required by applicable law.</p>

					<h6>15. AGREEMENT TERM AND TERMINATION</h6>

					<p>This section discusses when and how long this Agreement will last, when and how either you or Open-Label can end this Agreement, and what happens if either of us ends the Agreement.</p>

					<h6>15.1 TERMINATION</h6>

					<p>You and Open-Label both have the right to end this Agreement, but certain rights and obligations will survive after this Agreement ends.</p>

					<p>Unless both you and Open-Label expressly agree otherwise in writing, either of us may terminate this Agreement in our sole discretion at any time, without explanation, upon written notice to the other, which will result in the termination of the other Terms of Service as well, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. You may provide written notice to legalnotices@Open-Label.com. In the event you properly terminate this Agreement, your right to use the Services is automatically revoked, and your Account will be closed.</p>

					<p>You agree that Open-Label is not a party to any Service Contract between Users. Consequently, you understand and acknowledge that termination of this Agreement (or attempt to terminate this Agreement) does not terminate or otherwise impact any Service Contract or Project entered into between Users. If you attempt to terminate this Agreement while having one or more open Projects, you agree (a) you hereby instruct Open-Label will close any open contracts; (b) you will continue to be bound by this Agreement and the other Terms of Service until all such Projects have closed on the Site and your access to the Site has been terminated; (c) Open-Label will continue to perform those Services necessary to complete any open transaction between you and another User; and (d) you will continue to be obligated to pay any amounts accrued but unpaid as of the date of termination or as of the closure of any open Service Contracts, whichever is later, to Open-Label for any Services or such other amounts owed under the Terms of Service and to any Creators for any Creator Services.</p>

					<p>Without limiting Open-Label’s other rights or remedies, we may revoke or limit access to the Services, deny your registration, or revoke your access to the Site and refuse to provide any or all Services to you if: (i) you breach any terms and conditions of this Agreement or any portion of the Terms of Service; (ii) we have reasonable reason to believe that you have provided false or misleading information to us; (iii) we conclude that your actions may cause legal liability for you or others; may be contrary to the interests of the Site or the User community; or may involve illicit or illegal activity; or (iv) we are required to by law, legal process, or law enforcement. If your Account is temporarily or permanently closed, you may not use the Site under the same Account or a different Account or re-register for a new Account without Open-Label’s prior written consent. If you attempt to use the Site under a different Account, we reserve the right to reclaim available funds in that Account and/or use an available Payment Method to pay for any amounts owed by you to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

					<p>You acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Site depend on transparency of Users’ Account status to all Users, including you and other Users who have entered into Service Contracts with you. <strong>You therefore agree that: if Open-Label decides to temporarily or permanently close your account, Open-Label has the right (but no obligation) where allowed by law to: (y) notify other users that have entered into Service Contracts with you of your closed account status, and (z) provide those users with a summary of the reasons for your account closure. You agree that Open-Label will have no liability arising from or relating to any notice that it may or may not provide to any user regarding closed account status or the reason(s) for the closure.</strong></p>

					<h6>15.2 ACCOUNT DATA ON CLOSURE</h6>

					<p>Except as otherwise required by law, if your Account is closed, you will no longer have access to information or material you kept on the Site and any content stored in your Account may be deleted, for which Open-Label expressly disclaims liability.

					<h6>Except as otherwise required by law, if your Account is closed, you will no longer have access to information or material you kept on the Site and any content stored in your Account may be deleted, for which Open-Label expressly disclaims liability. Open-Label may retain some or all of your Account information as permitted or required by law and the Privacy Policy.</h6>

					<p>Section 15 discusses your agreement with Open-Label and our agreement with you about how we will resolve any disputes between us, including that we will both first try to resolve any dispute informally and, if you are in the United States, that we both agree to use arbitration instead of going to court or using a jury if we can’t resolve the dispute informally.</p>

					<p><strong>Please read the following paragraphs carefully because they require you and us to agree to resolve most all disputes between you and us through binding individual arbitration.</strong></p>

					<h6>15.1 DISPUTE PROCESS, ARBITRATION, AND SCOPE</h6>

					<p>If a dispute arises between you and Open-Label or our Affiliates, our goal is to resolve the dispute quickly and cost-effectively. Accordingly, unless you opt out as provided in Section 15.4.4 below, you, Open-Label, and our Affiliates agree to resolve any and all claims, disputes, or controversies that arise out of or relate to this Agreement, the other Terms of Service, your relationship with Open-Label (including without limitation any claimed employment with Open-Label or one of our Affiliates or successors), the termination of your relationship with Open-Label, or the Services (each a “<strong>Claim</strong>” and collectively, “<strong>Claims</strong>”) through binding arbitration on an individual basis in accordance with this Section 15 (sometimes referred to as the “<strong>Arbitration Provision</strong>”).</p>

					<p>Claims that may not be subject to predispute arbitration agreement as provided by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-203), Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (Public Law 117-90), or by generally applicable law are excluded from the coverage of this Arbitration Provision.</p>

					<p><strong>By agreeing to arbitrate disputes under this Agreement, THE PARTIES ARE EXPRESSLY GIVING UP ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OR COURT TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE. The parties instead elect to have Claims resolved by arbitration. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on the parties, subject to review on the grounds set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”)).</strong></p>

					<h6>15.2 CHOICE OF LAW</h6>

					<p>This Agreement, the Site Terms of Use, the other Terms of Service, and any Claim will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions; provided, however, that any Claims made by any Creator located within the United States will be governed by the law of the state in which such Creator resided at the time the dispute arose.</p>

					<p>However, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, this Arbitration Provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.).</p>

					<h6>15.3 INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h6>

					<p>Before serving a demand for arbitration of a Claim, you and Open-Label agree to first notify each other of the Claim. You agree to notify Open-Label of the Claim by email to legalnotices@Open-Label.com, and Open-Label agrees to provide to you a notice at your email address on file (in each case, a “Notice”). You and Open-Label then will seek informal voluntary resolution of the Claim. Any Notice must include pertinent account information, a brief description of the Claim, and contact information, so that you or Open-Label, as applicable, may evaluate the Claim and attempt to informally resolve it. Both you and Open-Label will have 60 days from the date of the receipt of the Notice to informally resolve the other party’s Claim and avoid the need for further action.</p>

					<h6>15.4 BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER (DOES NOT APPLY TO USERS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND ITS TERRITORIES)</h6>

					<p>This Arbitration Provision applies to all Users located in or who reside in the United States and its territories.</p>

					<p>In the unlikely event the parties are unable to resolve a Claim within 60 days of the receipt of the applicable Notice, you, Open-Label, and our Affiliates agree to resolve the Claim by final and binding individual arbitration before an arbitrator from JAMS, instead of a court or jury. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com.</p>

					<h6>15.4.1 SCOPE OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CONDUCT OF ARBITRATION</h6>

					<p>This Arbitration Provision applies to any Claim (defined above) the parties may have, whether based on past, prevent, or future events, and includes all claims and disputes that arose between the parties before the effective date of this Agreement, and survives after your relationship with Open-Label ends. For the avoidance of doubt, Claims covered by this Arbitration Provision include, but are not limited to, all claims, disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Terms of Service and the Open-Label Payroll Agreement. This Arbitration Provision is intended to apply to the resolution of disputes that otherwise would be resolved in a court of law or before a forum other than arbitration. If for any reason JAMS will not administer the arbitration, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction with authority over the location where the arbitration will be conducted for appointment of a neutral arbitrator.</p>

					<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures’ Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect. Arbitration of disputes brought by a User that allege a violation of a consumer protection statute also will be subject to the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards, and such arbitrations will be conducted in the same state and within 25 miles of where the User is located. Claims by Creators that allege employment or worker classification disputes will be conducted in the state and within 25 miles of where Creator is located in accordance with the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect. The applicable JAMS arbitration rules may be found at www.jamsadr.com or by searching online for “JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures,” “JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules,” or “JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards.” Any dispute regarding the applicability of a particular set of JAMS rules shall be resolved exclusively by the arbitrator. Any party will have the right to appear at the arbitration by telephone and/or video rather than in person.</p>

					<p>You and Open-Label will follow the applicable JAMS rules with respect to filing or initial appearance and arbitration fees. The arbitrator shall follow applicable law and may award only those remedies that would have applied had the matter been heard in court. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s decision in any court having jurisdiction.</p>

					<p>This Arbitration Provision does not apply to litigation between Open-Label and you that is or was already pending in a state or federal court or arbitration before the expiration of the opt-out period set forth in Section 15.4.4 below. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no amendment to this Arbitration Provision will apply to any matter pending in an arbitration proceeding brought under this Section 15 unless all parties to that arbitration consent in writing to that amendment.</p>

					<p>This Arbitration Provision also does not apply to claims for workers compensation, state disability insurance, or unemployment insurance benefits.</p>

					<p>Nothing in this Arbitration Provision prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with a government agency, including without limitation the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Nothing in this Arbitration Provision prevents the investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Provision. This Arbitration Provision also does not prevent federal administrative agencies from adjudicating claims and awarding remedies based on those claims, even if the claims would otherwise be covered by this Arbitration Provision. Nothing in this Arbitration Provision prevents or excuses a party from satisfying any conditions precedent or exhausting administrative remedies under applicable law before bringing a claim in arbitration. Open-Label will not retaliate against you for filing a claim with an administrative agency or for exercising rights (individually or in concert with others) under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.</p>

					<h6>15.4.2 INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION</h6>

					<p>This Arbitration Provision is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of Claims. The arbitrator shall have exclusive jurisdiction to decide all disputes arising out of or relating to the arbitrability of a Claim or the interpretation, enforcement, or application of this Arbitration Provision, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, breach, or validity of the Arbitration Provision or any portion of the Arbitration Provision, except as expressly provided below. All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court. The parties expressly agree that, except as provided by the Class and Collective Waiver section below, the arbitrator and not a court will decide any question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate, including but not limited to any claim that all or part of this Arbitration Provision, this Agreement, or any other part of the Terms of Service is void or voidable.</p>

					<p>In the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be enforceable, except as set forth in Section 15.4.3 below.</p>

					<h6>15.4.3 CLASS AND COLLECTIVE WAIVER</h6>

					<p>Private attorney general representative actions under the California Labor Code are not arbitrable, not within the scope of this Arbitration Provision and may be maintained in a court of law. However, this Arbitration Provision affects your ability to participate in class or collective actions. Both you and Open-Label agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis on behalf of others. There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action, or as a member in any such class or collective proceeding (“<strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>”). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the JAMS rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, scope, validity, or breach of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision herein shall be considered null and void in its entirety and the class or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings. You and Open-Label agree that you will not be retaliated against as a result of your filing or participating in a class or collective action in any forum. However, Open-Label may lawfully seek enforcement of this Arbitration Provision and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of such class or collective actions or claims.</p>
